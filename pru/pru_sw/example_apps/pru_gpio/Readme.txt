This PRU code is based on a number of PRU examples.  It leverages the DMX example from boxysean
as the base.  I followed the basic instructions on http://blog.boxysean.com/2012/08/12/first-steps-with-the-beaglebone-pru/
to build for the beaglebone black.  

The PRU device drive must be loaded.  I used information found in various places to force it to load on the black.
I have uploaded an enable_pru.sh script that I use to load the driver.

Many thanks to all those that took the time to put their knowledge online. 

Note : None of this code is written for any serious purpose.  It is just hacked together for fun and learning.
